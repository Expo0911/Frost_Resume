% This template uses several fonts not included with Windows/Linux by

% TODO:
% 1. Integrate biber/bibtex for article citation under publications.
% 2. Figure out a smoother way for the document to flow onto the next page.
% 3. Add styling information for a "Projects/Hacks" section.
% 4. Add location/address information
% 5. Merge OpenFont and MacFonts as a single sty with options.

\runsubsection{Database Management System}
\location{Spring 2015| NCSU}
%\vspace{\topsep}
%\begin{tightemize}
%\item Designed a database to assist with the administration of the University Housing Office. Students can view available houses based on different criteria, check status of lease related requests, invoices, maintenance tickets and parking. Housing staff can view and act on different requests. 
%\item Designed database using E-R model, created database by Oracle MySQL, managed database on Java by JDBC, built a website for Housing Office and students to operate.

\location{Fall 2014| NCSU}
%\begin{tightemize}
\textbullet{ } Designed a simple website using node.js, applying bootstrap to create layout and knockout.js to process dynamic content, adding visualization component by d3.js, using grunt to manage build tasks. \\
\textbullet{ } Performed unit testing on mocking the server response from Twitter.

\runsubsection{Computer Performance Modeling}
\location{Spring 2014| NCSU}
%\begin{tightemize}
\textbullet{ }  Applied Markov process queueing-based models to simulate the general M/G/1 queueing problem in computer \& communication systems by C++. Computed performance measures of throughput and delay for given queueing system with different number of servers and different queueing priorities.
%\end{tightemize}
\sectionsep

\runsubsection{Internet Protocols}
\location{Fall 2013| NCSU}
%\begin{tightemize}
\textbullet{ }  Implemented go-back-N and selective repeat automatic repeat request (ARQ) scheme to a simple Peer to Peer system with a centralized index, in which a concurrent server is capable of carrying out communication with multiple clients. When peers join in this P2P system, they can add their local file names to file list in the server, and query, request to download files from some destination peers over TCP.
